# MTGRules
MTGRules Xamarin App 

*This project replaced https://github.com/ivancea/MTGRules_UWP, a UWP solution.*

The main objective of this application is to provide a history of **Magic: The Gathering** rule sets, and the ability to compare, search and navigate them.

This was my second Xamarin application, a pet project I made replacing the UWP old one because I changed my phone from a Microsoft Lumia to an Android.
*You probably won't find here good coding practices (In the context of a Xamarin application).*
